# pit-scout-2016
The 2016 FRC 1678 Pit-Scout app. Run on an iPhone 5s. A student visits all the pits in the competition and talks to the teams to gather information like number of wheels on the robot, pit organization etc. They also take and upload photos of the robot.

Use Notes:
To select the "selected image", view the images and then tap on the one you want to select. This will set the selected image url, and dismiss the image gallery so that you can continue adding data.

If you add 5 or more images for a given team, you run the risk of causing the image gallery to significantly lag, and possibly crash.
